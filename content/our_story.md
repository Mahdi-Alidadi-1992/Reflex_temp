LovePacked began with my earliest memories of my mom’s care. She was a full-time teacher, always busy and juggling a thousand things. Some meals were simple, some flopped, and sometimes we just ate and moved on. Yet in all that chaos, she still found ways to make mealtime feel special.
She believed every bite mattered, shaping not just the child I was but the adult I’d become. Food was her way of nurturing me physically and emotionally. She told silly little stories about vegetables and fruits, bringing carrots and broccoli to life so I’d grow curious instead of resistant. Those moments of storytelling and eating together became some of my fondest memories.
I also saw her worry; whether I was eating enough, getting the right balance, or building habits that would last. She worried about my school lunches too; how to keep them fresh, healthy, and not returned untouched. Sometimes she tucked in funny notes with little veggie stories I’d share with friends. She believed that if I could enjoy those habits with others, they’d feel fun and natural, and more likely to stick.
Because of her, I still reach for healthy options over junk food, not because I have to but because I want to. The stories stuck. The habits stuck. But most of all, the love stuck.
LovePacked is my tribute to that care; a belief that kids’ health matters, that parenthood should feel more like an adventure than a burden, and that the small bonding moments in the chaos are worth protecting. That’s why we’re listening, learning, and exploring ways to give those moments back to parents by lightening their load. Because feeding our kids, raising them, loving them; it doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to be real.
