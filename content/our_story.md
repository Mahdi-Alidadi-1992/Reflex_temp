## Our Story

LovePacked was inspired by my mom, a full-time teacher who still showed up with so much care and made healthy food feel like friends. When I turned my nose up at veggies, she didn’t push; she told tiny stories that made them less scary and more fun. In our house, broccoli became little trees with shields that help keep sniffles away; carrots turned into rocket ships that help you see in the dark; and blueberries became brain sparkles for puzzles. After a few rounds of those stories, I got curious and ate more. It wasn’t easy. Many nights she was tired, ideas flopped, and we simply ate and moved on. Most parents don’t have time to do all that; that’s exactly why we’re building LovePacked: dietitian-designed, kid-approved meals with playful touches that lighten your mental load while helping kids build happy, healthy eating habits.

With love,<br>
